## API Dependencies (v4 new)

| API | Usage | Required | Fallback |
|-----|-------|----------|----------|
| Semantic Scholar API | Citation verification in `literature-review` Stage 3.5 and `scholarly-writing` Stage 2.5 | Optional | LLM self-verification (lower confidence) |
| SJR/SNIP data | Journal quality ranking in `literature-review` Stage 4.5 | Optional | Venue tier classification as proxy |
| VLM (Vision Language Model) | Figure quality review in `scientific-figure-making` Stage 3 | Optional | Skip VLM review; manual user review |

### Semantic Scholar API Details

- **Endpoint**: `https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search`
- **Rate limit**: 100 requests per 5 minutes (unauthenticated), 1000 per 5 minutes (with API key)
- **Usage**: Verify that cited papers exist and are correctly attributed
- **When unavailable**: Fall back to LLM self-verification with explicit `[LLM-VERIFIED]` marking
- **No API key required**: Basic usage works without authentication; API key recommended for higher rate limits

## Version Policy

- **Concept-level references** (Auto-Scholar, DeepPaperNote, autoresearch-skill, Scholarly, figures4papers, PaperOrchestra, AI Scientist-v2, Google AI Co-Scientist, LiRA, AutoSurvey2, Paperguide.ai): These are design inspirations, not code dependencies. The Skill directories in this project contain original usage guides written based on their concepts, not copies of their code. No version pinning is required.

- **Content-level references** (awesome-ai-research-writing): This is a Prompt library that users clone into the project. Its content directly affects Skill execution quality. Commit pinning is recommended for reproducibility.

- **API dependencies** (Semantic Scholar API): These are optional external services. The project is designed to degrade gracefully when APIs are unavailable.

## Important Notes

- This project does **not** redistribute content from any upstream repository.
- Each Skill directory contains original documentation written by this project, inspired by the upstream design concepts.
- `skills/critical-ideation/` is an original contribution of this project with no upstream dependency.
- `skills/deep-research/` is a v4 new skill inspired by Paperguide.ai's Deep Research feature.
- Users should visit upstream repositories directly and comply with their respective licenses and terms of use.
- API dependencies are optional; all skills function without them but with reduced verification confidence.
