## 10. Full Workflow

The complete workflow chain from literature review to reviewer check (v4 enhanced):

```text
literature-review → paper-reading → critical-ideation → experiment-design → scientific-figure-making → scholarly-writing + awesome-ai-research-writing → reviewer_check
```

Each skill's internal workflow has been enhanced in v4:

- `literature-review`: + citation verification + journal quality ranking + Workbooks mode
- `critical-ideation`: + Generate-Debate-Evolve cycle
- `scientific-figure-making`: + VLM review loop + concept diagram generation
- `scholarly-writing`: + structured JSON outline + citation grounding + parallel writing
- `reviewer_check`: + multi-perspective review + review-rollback mechanism

### Full Pipeline

When a user wants to go from zero to a complete paper:

1. Use `literature-review` to survey the field and identify gaps (with citation verification and quality ranking).
2. Use `paper-reading` to deeply read key papers and generate notes.
3. Use `critical-ideation` to generate, challenge, debate, and converge on a research direction.
4. Use `experiment-design` to plan experiments, define variables, and design ablation studies.
5. Use `scientific-figure-making` to visualize experimental evidence (with VLM quality review).
6. Use `scholarly-writing` to build the paper structure (with JSON outline and citation grounding) and draft each section.
7. Use `awesome-ai-research-writing` to polish the draft.
8. Use `reviewer_check` to run multi-perspective review with rollback mechanism.

### Deep Research Pipeline (v4 new)

When a user wants a comprehensive research landscape report:

```text
deep-research → (optional) critical-ideation → scholarly-writing + awesome-ai-research-writing → reviewer_check
```

1. Use `deep-research` to discover, filter, extract, analyze trends, and synthesize a comprehensive report.
2. Optionally use `critical-ideation` to identify promising directions from the report.
3. Use `scholarly-writing` + `awesome-ai-research-writing` to write up the findings.
4. Use `reviewer_check` to verify quality.

### Partial Pipelines

**Review + Reading + Ideation** (no writing yet):

```text
literature-review -> paper-reading -> critical-ideation
```

**Ideation + Experiment Design** (already have a direction):

```text
critical-ideation -> experiment-design
```

**Experiment + Figure + Writing** (already have results):

```text
experiment-design -> scientific-figure-making -> scholarly-writing -> awesome-ai-research-writing -> reviewer check
```

**Figure + Writing** (already have results and experiment plan):

```text
scientific-figure-making -> scholarly-writing -> awesome-ai-research-writing -> reviewer check
```

**Deep Research only** (comprehensive landscape report):

```text
deep-research
```

## 12. Important Safety Rule

Do not modify toolkit source files unless the user explicitly asks to update the toolkit itself.

When working inside another project, all generated outputs must be saved into the current project directory, not into the toolkit directory.
